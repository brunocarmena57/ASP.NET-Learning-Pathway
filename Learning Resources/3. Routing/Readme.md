# Routing

In this section, I learned about routing in ASP.NET Core, which allows mapping incoming requests to controllers and actions based on the URL patterns. I learned about the following concepts:

<strong>Map:</strong> a method used to define a route for a specific URL pattern and HTTP method.

<strong>MapGet</strong> and <strong>MapPost:</strong> methods used to define a route for a GET or POST HTTP request.


<strong>Route parameters:</strong> placeholders in the URL pattern that capture values from the incoming request.


<strong>Default parameters:</strong> optional values for route parameters that can be used to simplify the URL pattern.


<strong>Custom route constraint class:</strong> a way to define custom logic to validate a route parameter.


<strong>Endpoint selection order:</strong> the order in which ASP.NET Core selects a matching endpoint for a given request.


<strong>WebRoot:</strong> the root directory of the web application, which is used to serve static files.

Here are some questions that you could find helpful:

### 1. What is Routing?

Routing is the process of determining how an incoming request is handled by the application. In ASP.NET Core, routing is responsible for matching incoming URLs to actions in the application.

By using routing in my ASP.NET Core applications, I can define clear and meaningful URLs for my users and map them to specific controller actions that handle the requests. I also learned how to use custom route constraints to validate route parameters and how to organize my static files in the WebRoot directory.
