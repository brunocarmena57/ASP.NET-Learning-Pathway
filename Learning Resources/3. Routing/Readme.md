# Routing

In this section, I learned about routing in ASP.NET Core, which allows mapping incoming requests to controllers and actions based on the URL patterns. I learned about the following concepts:

<strong>Map:</strong> a method used to define a route for a specific URL pattern and HTTP method.
MapGet and MapPost: methods used to define a route for a GET or POST HTTP request.
Route parameters: placeholders in the URL pattern that capture values from the incoming request.
Default parameters: optional values for route parameters that can be used to simplify the URL pattern.
Custom route constraint class: a way to define custom logic to validate a route parameter.
Endpoint selection order: the order in which ASP.NET Core selects a matching endpoint for a given request.
WebRoot: the root directory of the web application, which is used to serve static files.
By using routing in my ASP.NET Core applications, I can define clear and meaningful URLs for my users and map them to specific controller actions that handle the requests. I also learned how to use custom route constraints to validate route parameters and how to organize my static files in the WebRoot directory.
